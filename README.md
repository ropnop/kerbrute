[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/ropnop/kerbrute.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/ropnop/kerbrute)

A tool to quickly bruteforce and enumerate valid Active Directory accounts through Kerberos Pre-Authentication

Grab the latest binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute/releases/latest) to get started.

## Background
This tool grew out of some [bash scripts](https://github.com/ropnop/kerberos_windows_scripts) I wrote a few years ago to perform bruteforcing using the Heimdal Kerberos client from Linux. I wanted something that didn't require privileges to install a Kerberos client, and when I found the amazing pure Go implementation of Kerberos [gokrb5](https://github.com/jcmturner/gokrb5), I decided to finally learn Go and write this. 

Bruteforcing Windows passwords with Kerberos is much faster than any other approach I know of, and potentially stealthier since pre-authentication failures do not trigger that "traditional" `An account failed to log on` event 4625. With Kerberos, you can validate a username or test a login by only sending one UDP frame to the KDC (Domain Controller)

For more background and information, check out my Troopers 2019 talk, Fun with LDAP and Kerberos (link TBD)

## Usage
Kerbrute has three main commands:
 * **bruteuser** - Bruteforce a single user's password from a wordlist
 * **bruteforce** - Read username:password combos from a file or stdin and test them
 * **passwordspray** - Test a single password against a list of users
 * **userenum** - Enumerate valid domain usernames via Kerberos

A domain (`-d`) or a domain controller (`--dc`) must be specified. If a Domain Controller is not given the KDC will be looked up via DNS.

By default, Kerbrute is multithreaded and uses 10 threads. This can be changed with the `-t` option.

Output is logged to stdout, but a log file can be specified with `-o`.

By default, failures are not logged, but that can be changed with `-v`.

Lastly, Kerbrute has a `--safe` option. When this option is enabled, if an account comes back as locked out, it will abort all threads to stop locking out any other accounts.

The `help` command can be used for more information

```

Version: dev (n/a) - 12/14/19 - Ronnie Flathers @ropnop

This tool is designed to assist in quickly bruteforcing valid Active Directory accounts through Kerberos Pre-Authentication.
It is designed to be used on an internal Windows domain with access to one of the Domain Controllers.
Warning: failed Kerberos Pre-Auth counts as a failed login and WILL lock out accounts

Usage:
  kerbrute [command]

Available Commands:
  bruteforce    Bruteforce username:password combos, from a file or stdin
  bruteuser     Bruteforce a single user's password from a wordlist
  help          Help about any command
  passwordspray Test a single password against a list of users
  userenum      Enumerate valid domain usernames via Kerberos
  version       Display version info and quit

Flags:
      --dc string       The location of the Domain Controller (KDC) to target. If blank, will lookup via DNS
      --delay int       Delay in millisecond between each attempt. Will always use single thread if set
  -d, --domain string   The full domain to use (e.g. contoso.com)
  -h, --help            help for kerbrute
  -o, --output string   File to write logs to. Optional.
      --safe            Safe mode. Will abort if any user comes back as locked out. Default: FALSE
  -t, --threads int     Threads to use (default 10)
  -v, --verbose         Log failures and errors

Use "kerbrute [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### User Enumeration
To enumerate usernames, Kerbrute sends TGT requests with no pre-authentication. If the KDC responds with a `PRINCIPAL UNKNOWN` error, the username does not exist. However, if the KDC prompts for pre-authentication, we know the username exists and we move on. This does not cause any login failures so it will not lock out any accounts. This generates a Windows event ID [4768](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=4768) if Kerberos logging is enabled.

```

```

### Password Spray
With `passwordspray`, Kerbrute will perform a horizontal brute force attack against a list of domain users. This is useful for testing one or two common passwords when you have a large list of users. WARNING: this does will increment the failed login count and lock out accounts. This will generate both event IDs [4768 - A Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT) was requested](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=4768) and [4771 - Kerberos pre-authentication failed](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=4771)

### Brute User
This is a traditional bruteforce account against a username. Only run this if you are sure there is no lockout policy! This will generate both event IDs [4768 - A Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT) was requested](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=4768) and [4771 - Kerberos pre-authentication failed](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=4771)

### Brute Force
This mode simply reads username and password combinations (in the format `username:password`) from a file or from `stdin` and tests them with Kerberos PreAuthentication. It will skip any blank lines or lines with blank usernames/passwords. This will generate both event IDs [4768 - A Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT) was requested](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=4768) and [4771 - Kerberos pre-authentication failed](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=4771)

## Credits
Huge shoutout to jcmturner for his pure Go implementation of KRB5: https://github.com/jcmturner/gokrb5 . An amazing project and very well documented. Couldn't have done any of this without that project. 

Shoutout to [audibleblink](https://github.com/audibleblink) for the suggestion and implementation of the `delay` option!
